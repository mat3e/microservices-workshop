# Angular - architectural decisions
Angular is known in the front-end world for some time. There were problems with this framework, especially before its second version. Then, introducing this second version went worse than planned and it still has less GitHub stars than Angular 1.x (a.k.a. AngularJS).

In this talk I want to give an overview on how Angular is designed and what the code written with it looks like.
